### On a mission from God ðŸ•¶ <sup>*</sup>

After 3 years of software engineering, I started focussing more on what always fascinated me: IT security. Currently, I support cybersecurity audits - mostly PCI DSS - across various industries. Complementary to my hands-on work, I'm pursuing my consecutive Master's Degree in Informatics at the Technical University of Munich. Things I value are honesty, passion, ownership, continuous learning, and a good Risotto.
