### On a mission from God ðŸ•¶

After 3 years of software engineering, I started focussing more on what always fascinated me: IT security.
Currently, I mainly perform threat analyses, penetration tests, and security code reviews for German SMEs.
However, I'm also broadly interested in anything else related to IT security. I'm particularly excited to learn more about topics like risk management, social engineering, infrastructure red/blue teaming, and incident response.
Complementary to my hands-on work, I'm pursuing my master's degree in computer science at the Technical University of Munich.
Things I value: honesty, passion, ownership, continuous learning, and a good Risotto.
